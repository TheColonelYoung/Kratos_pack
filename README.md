PCB is placed on top of batteries, so contact on bottom of board touch positive side of one battery and negative of other.
On other side batteries are connected only with metal bridge with spring contact to which is soldered cable which leads to connector on board. This wire is used to read voltage of individual batteries and balance then during charging.
